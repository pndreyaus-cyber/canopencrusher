# Purpose of the repository
I am building a simple embedded control system for a 6-axis robot arm that can reliably move joints to target angles with feedback over CAN, intended as a working prototype for an exhibition

## What's enough for my bachelors project?
* motors reach target
* errors detected
* system recoverable
* demo works repeatedly
P.S. It is truly enough -- you supervisors said it.

As I am new to embedded/microcontrollers/robotics/programming, I want my code to have these features:
- explicit
- simple
- readable
- testable

## The right moments to ask my supervsior
> You do not need to wait for “finished” 

The right moment to ask is when you can say:
- “Here’s what works now.
- Here’s what I’m unsure about.
- Here’s what I plan to do next — does this make sense?”
