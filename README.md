# Purpose of the repository
I am building a simple embedded control system for a 6-axis robot arm that can reliably move joints to target angles with feedback over CAN, intended as a working prototype for an exhibition

# What's enough for my bachelors project (and it really is enough -- as my supervisors said)
* motors reach target
* errors detected
* system recoverable
* demo works repeatedly
